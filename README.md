# Startup-Company-EDA
Exploratory Analysis of Company Financial Metrics

This project allows startup creators to choose see the potential in different types of startups and the tradeoffs that come with scalability and chance of profitability.
It calculates the Average Probability of Profitability of Startup Industries, and measures Scalability Using Valuation to Funding Ratios. 

*Columns regrading valuation, funding, and revenue are in the dataset are measured by millions.*

Screenshot below: 
Using the data in this table, we can clearly see that Internet of Things (IoT) industry companies require less funding and have the highest chance of probability. 
However, the valuation of IoT isn't as scalable as some of the other industries! The average valuation of IoT startups are relatively low.

Screenshot below:
Top 5 monetary valuation startups and whether they are profitable or not, as well as the probability of the industry being profitable. (For example, a 0.56 industry_profit_chance means 56% probability of the startup being profitable).
It seems that E-Commerce seems to be profitable at the top startups ranked by valuation. Cybersecurity, on the other hand, not really. 
In my previous queries, however, I've shown that valuation for cybersecurity companies have on average ~70% more valuation than IoT.

In conclusion, E-Commerce seems to be profitable for startups, but Cybersecurity offers more scalability depending on what the end user's goal is.
